# Eagle Shared Index
This is an experimental project to create a foundation for BRAT on Eagle.

## 📝 What is BRAT?
BRAT stands for Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool from Obsidian.

## ❓ What is this project?
Unlike Obsidian's plugin ecosystem which uses a centralized GitHub repository for plugin indexing, Eagle currently relies on proprietary hosting for plugins. This initiative aims to create an unofficial, community-driven index that will facilitate streamlined collaboration between plugin developers and users within Eagle's third-party plugin ecosystem.
